% IMPORTANT: THIS TEMPLATE NEEDS TO BE COMPILED WITH XeLaTeX

% This template uses several fonts not included with Windows/Linux by
% default. If you get compilation errors saying a font is missing, find the line
% on which the font is used and either change it to a font included with your
% operating system or comment the line out to use the default font.

% 5. Merge OpenFont and MacFonts as a single sty with options.
